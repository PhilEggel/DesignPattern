/**
 * <h1>Mediator Design Pattern</h1>
 * <p>It is used to handle communication between related objects
 * (Colleagues)</p>
 * <p>All communication is handled by the Mediator and the Colleagues don't
 * need to know anything about each other</p>
 * <p>GOF: Allows loose coupling by encapsulating the way disparate sets
 * of objects interact and communicate with each other. Allocs for
 * the actions of each object set to vary independently on one another</p>
